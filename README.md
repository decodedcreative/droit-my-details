# Droit - My Details

A simple form page built in React with Typescript which utilises data retrieved from a Java-based API. For a full technical overview of the approach taken see [Project Notes](NOTES.md)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This app uses a Java API to provide data to the front-end React application. The executable `.jar` file is found in the root of the project and is executed along with `react scripts start` as part of this command. See `package.json` for more details.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. However there were no unit tests written as part of this project.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
